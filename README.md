**Cube** is a generative AI application that allows you to describe a web page or component in plain English and watch as it gets built and deployed in real-time. It leverages a sophisticated multi-agent system to interpret requests, write code, and run it in a secure cloud environment.

<!-- Optional: Add a screenshot or GIF of the application in action -->

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **From Idea to Live App, Instantly**: Describe the web application you want, and our AI will build and deploy it for you in real-time.
- **Live, Interactive Previews**: See your generated website come to life in a real-time preview and interact with it as you build.
- **Live & Secure Sandboxes (Powered by E2B)**: Each project is built in a dedicated cloud sandbox, providing a secure, instantly-deployed environment and a shareable live URL.
- **Full Code Access & Transparency**: Get complete access to the generated source code, with the ability to view and download it at any time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

Cube's magic lies in its robust, event-driven architecture that coordinates multiple services to turn a prompt into a running web application.

1.  **User Prompt**: The user submits a request through the Next.js web interface.
2.  **Orchestration Layer**: An **Inngest** function picks up the request and begins a durable, long-running workflow.
3.  **Secure Sandbox Creation**: Inngest spins up a secure, isolated **E2B** cloud sandbox for the AI to work in.
4.  **AI Code Generation**: A **Google Gemini**-powered AI agent is invoked inside the sandbox. It has access to a file system, a terminal, and other tools necessary to build a web application.
5.  **Real-Time Deployment**: As the agent works, it runs a development server inside the sandbox, which is exposed via a secure, public URL for the user to preview.
6.  **Saving the Result**: Once the build is complete, the final code is saved to the database via **Prisma**, and the user is presented with the final result.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (v20.x or later)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cube.git
cd cube
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
bun install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Now, fill in the required values in `.env.local`:

```env
# Prisma
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"

# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=

# Inngest
INNGEST_EVENT_KEY=
INNGEST_SIGNING_KEY=

# E2B
E2B_API_KEY=

# Google Gemini
GOOGLE_API_KEY=
```

### 4. Set Up the Database

Run the Prisma migrations to set up your database schema.

```bash
bunx prisma migrate dev
```

### 5. Run the Development Server

Now you can start the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
